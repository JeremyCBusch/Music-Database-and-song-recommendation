# Music-Database-and-Song-Recommendation

# Overview

{This is a python file that creates a database with SQLite. You are able to add and delete artist, albums, and tracks. You can also edit an artist name. Python algorithms are used to recommend music based on a song that the user chooses}

{I created this software because I am passionate about music and would love to work for a compnay that would allow me to write algorithms the reccomend better music to more people. I am confident that music can change lives, and it can change more lives if we bring more music that people enjoy to them.}
